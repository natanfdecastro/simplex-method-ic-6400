Implementation of the Simplex Method algorithm to solve linear programming maximization and minimization problems. 


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* `pip3` installed, the package installer for Python. Installation:
```
sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip
```
* `PyQt5 5.15.4` installed, set of cross-platform C++ libraries that implement high-level APIs for accessing many aspects of modern desktop and mobile systems. Installation:
```
pip3 install PyQt5
```
* `qt-material 2.8.4` installed, stylesheet for PySide6, PySide2 and PyQt5, which looks like Material Design. Installation:
```
pip3 install qt-material
```

### Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/natanfdecastro/simplex-method-ic-6400
   ```
2. Go to `src/main/python/edu/tec/ic6400/` and run:
   ```sh
   python3 simplex-program.py
   ```
3. The main window should appear, introduce the data for the problems and the options
4. You can add more variables and restrictions (max of 17 variables)
5. Choose to generate a .txt file with the solution or not
6. Click on solve
7. The solved problem should look something like this:
